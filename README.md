# File Description

This file contains a comprehensive tutorial and exercises on various data analysis techniques, designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world datasets. The content is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis:

## 1. Iris Dataset Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Utilize `cor.test()` to calculate correlations between variables.
  - Interpret the results to understand relationships between different features.
- **Scatter Plot:**
  - Create scatter plots using `plot()` to visualize data distributions and relationships.
  - Customize plots with titles, labels, and colors for better clarity.
- **Adjacency Matrix:**
  - Generate adjacency matrices using `cor()` to represent correlations.
  - Analyze the matrix to identify strong and weak correlations.
- **SPLOM Graphics:**
  - Create scatterplot matrices using `pairs()` and `pairs.panels()` to visualize pairwise relationships.
  - Enhance plots with additional features like histograms and correlation coefficients.

## 2. Run Data Analysis
- **Regression Analysis:**
  - Plot data points and create regression lines to model relationships.
  - Compute the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to quantify the strength of linear relationships.
- **Multiple Regression Model:**
  - Develop multiple regression models using `lm()` to predict final run distances based on previous runs.
  - Use `predict()` to make predictions and evaluate model performance.
- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Build logistic regression models with `glm()` to predict binary outcomes (e.g., survival on the Titanic).
  - Interpret model coefficients and assess model accuracy.

## 3. Time Series Analysis
- **Plotting Time Series:**
  - Use `ts()` to plot time series data and study trends over time.
  - Apply regression lines and moving averages to identify patterns.
- **Seasonality and Decomposition:**
  - Analyze seasonality trends and decompose time series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
  - Use decomposition to better understand underlying patterns.
- **Auto-correlation:**
  - Compute auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation for different lags to identify dependencies.
  - Visualize auto-correlation functions (ACF) and partial auto-correlation functions (PACF).
- **ARIMA Modelling:**
  - Fit ARIMA models to time series data to capture trends and seasonality.
  - Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like AIC and BIC.

## 4. Additional Resources
- **Reading:**
  - Explore chapters on regression methods and time series analysis for in-depth understanding.
  - Refer to recommended textbooks and articles for further reading.
- **External Links:**
  - Access additional tutorials and datasets for further practice and exploration.
  - Utilize online resources to enhance learning and application of data analysis techniques.
